Set up for Table ROlling, first line is number of rolls, folowed by Tables you want rolled on.  <br>
It is a good idea to have the highest level table first, an exmaple would be the Main Table, or table that has the largest branches. <br>
Each table should start with "--New Table" and end with "--End Table" no quotes.  <br>
The first line is how many times you want to test the rolls <br>
After the start of the table the first line should be reading in the table name.  <br>
After that each line of the table should have the chance then the Value. <br>
